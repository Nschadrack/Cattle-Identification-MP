	abstract = {Fingerprint recognition is the most widely used identification method at present. However, it still falls short in terms of cross-platform and algorithmic complexity, which exerts a certain effect on the migration of fingerprint data and the development of the system. The conventional image recognition methods require offline standard databases constructed in advance for image access efficiency. The database can provide a pre-processed image via a specific method that probably is compatible merely with the specific recognition algorithm. Then, the specific recognition algorithm starts the process of retrieving these specific pre-proessing images for recognition and inevitably will be blocked from other datasets. The proposed method in this research designed an embedded image processing algorithm based on a Siamese neural network in the recognition method that allows the proposed method to recognize images from any source without constructing a database for image storage in advance. In this research, the proposed method was applied to fingerprint recognition and evaluation of the proposed method was evaluated. The results showed that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm was up to 92\%, and its F 1 score was up to 0.87. Compared with the conventional fingerprint matching methods, its significant advantage in the FRR, FAR, and CR jointly indicated the remarkable correct recognition rate of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Fingerprint recognition is regarded as the most reliable and accurate biometric identification system. Most traditional fingerprint identification systems use digital image processing technology rather than new deep learning technology. While, provided that the image quality is bad, the accuracy of the traditional fingerprint system maybe could not reach the ideal value. In this paper, we created three different Siamese networks based on CNN structures to compare the impact of network structure on fingerprint recognition accuracy. The three CNN networks are self-defined net, AlexNet, and VGG. We use dynamic adjustment of the threshold to make it more adaptable to a variety of data sets. The biggest difference between these three networks is the number of parameters. In the experiment, we use the data set of 1000 factorial pairs, and the average accuracy of fingerprint recognition is 97\%, 94\%, and 51\% respectively. And then, we mainly discuss that the Siamese network based on CNN has an excellent advantage in fingerprint recognition, and the struct of CNN is the key to affect the accuracy of fingerprint recognition.},

	abstract = {Biometric deals with the verification and identification of a person based on behavioural and physiological traits. This article presents recent advances in physiological-based biometric multimodalities, where we focused on finger vein, palm vein, fingerprint, face, lips, iris, and retina-based processing methods. The authors also evaluated the architecture, operational mode, and performance metrics of biometric technology. In this article, the authors summarize and study various traditional and deep learning-based physiological-based biometric modalities. An extensive review of biometric steps of multiple modalities by using different levels such as preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification, are presented in detail. Challenges and future trends of existing conventional and deep learning approaches are explained in detail to help the researcher. Moreover, traditional and deep learning methods of various physiological-based biometric systems are roughly analyzed to evaluate them. The comparison result and discussion section of this article indicate that there is still a need to develop a robust physiological-based method to advance and improve the performance of the biometric system.},

	abstract = {Fingerprints are the most widely deployed form of biometric identification. No two individuals share the same fingerprint because they have unique biometric identifiers. This paper presents an efficient fingerprint verification algorithm which improves matching accuracy. Fingerprint images get degraded and corrupted due to variations in skin and impression conditions. Thus, image enhancement techniques are employed prior to singular point detection and minutiae extraction. Singular point is the point of maximum curvature. It is determined by the normalâ€™s of each fingerprint ridge, and then following them inward towards the centre. The local ridge features known as minutiae is extracted using cross-number method to find ridge endings and ridge bifurcations. The proposed algorithm chooses a radius and draws a circle with core point as centre, making fingerprint images rotationally invariant and uniform. The radius can be varied according to the accuracy depending on the particular application. Morphological techniques such as clean, spur and H-break is employed to remove noise, followed by removing spurious minutiae. Templates are created based on feature vector extraction and databases are made for verification and identification for the fingerprint images taken from Fingerprint Verification Competition (FVC2002). Minimum Euclidean distance is calculated between saved template and the test fingerprint image template and compared with the set threshold for matching decision. For the performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm various measures, equal error rate (EER), D at EER, accuracy and threshold are evaluated and plotted. The measures demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more effective and robust.},

	abstract = {Deep learning-based models have been very successful in achieving state-of-the-art results in many of the computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing tasks in the last few years. These models seem a natural fit for handling the ever-increasing scale of biometric recognition problems, from cellphone authentication to airport security systems. Deep learning-based models have increasingly been leveraged to improve the accuracy of different biometric recognition systems in recent years. In this work, we provide a comprehensive survey of more than 120 promising works on biometric recognition (including face, fingerprint, iris, palmprint, ear, voice, signature, and gait recognition), which deploy deep learning models, and show their strengths and potentials in different applications. For each biometric, we first introduce the available datasets that are widely used in the literature and their characteristics. We will then talk about several promising deep learning works developed for that biometric, and show their performance on popular public benchmarks. We will also discuss some of the main challenges while using these models for biometric recognition, and possible future directions to which research in this area is headed.},
