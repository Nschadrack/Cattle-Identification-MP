# Cow Identification Using Deep Learning
# Introduction
Biometric systems utilize various methods for identifying humans, and we believe this approach can be effectively applied to cows. Traditionally, cows have been identified using methods like ear tags, tattoos, and electronic chips. However, these techniques often involve piercing different parts of the cow, potentially leading to infections and other health-related concerns.

Artificial Intelligence, specifically deep learning, is a rapidly growing field trusted to solve complex and significant problems. In this context, we have adapted deep learning to develop a scalable model capable of identifying cows using their muzzleprint images. This method is analogous to human biometric identification systems, such as facial recognition used in smartphone unlocking and fingerprint verification. Our approach aims to offer a non-invasive, efficient, and reliable alternative for cow identification.
